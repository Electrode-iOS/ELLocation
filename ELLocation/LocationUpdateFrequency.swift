 Callback frequency setting. Lowest power consumption is achieved by combining LocationUpdateFrequency.ChangesOnly
 with LocationAccuracy.Coarse

 - ChangesOnly: Notify listeners only when location changes. The granularity of this depends on the LocationAccuracy setting
 - Continuous:  Notify listeners at regular, frequent intervals (~1-2s)
